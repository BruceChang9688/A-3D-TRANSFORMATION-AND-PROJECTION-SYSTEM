WELCOME TO PROJECT2 "A 3D TRANSFORMATION AND PROJECTION SYSTEM"

PREPARATION
1. Make Project2.
2. Input the file address.
3. Finish reading and we can transform the objects in the file.
4. Make an output file.

PROJECTION
1. There are three blocks that show the object in Three planes.
2. The up left one is the xy-plane, and the blue axis is the x axis and y axis.
3. The bottom left one is the yz-plane, and the blue axis is the y axis and z axis.
4. The up right one is the xz-plane, and the blue axis is the x axis and z axis.
5. Press 't' to continue transforming

TRANSFORMING
1. The program will show the user how many objects are in this scene. Choose which object the user want to transform.
2. Choose which transformation the user want to implement.
 '1' for translation
 '2' for rotation
 '3' for scaling
3. In order to make the transformation easier, the program give two hints for user.
 (1) the gravity point of the object which the user want to transform.
 (2) if the user want to make a rotation, they can see the rotation axis as a red line in scene after they input it.
4. The output file will update the information of points for objects after transformation.
5. Press 't' to make a new transformation.
